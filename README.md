Materials for COS PICRC training

These materials were developed in 202.

## 2024 Update
We updated the links to the YouTube videos in the Data Visualization modules according to Stanford's new links to the corresponding videos (upon the Stanford team's request). To do this, we had to update the GitHub action to the most recent version of several jobs and update the GH Token and email. The email used was the GitHub user email associated with the person who created the token. The email and token are saved as secrets in this repo. 

To update video links, we copied the embed link directly from YouTube and pasted it on the corresponding line of the Rmd.
