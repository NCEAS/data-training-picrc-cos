To address this need, data enthusiasts - such as you - have an opportunity to expand their knowledge base in working with complex data sets to creatively convey impactful, data-driven messages to a variety of audiences. This compilation of training materials is intended to provide an accessible, digestible resource for anyone interested in any aspect of data management or visualization. Background: This compilation of data management and visualization training materials stems from a multi-year engagement amongst the Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC), the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions (COS), and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) through financial support by Future Earth. The funding supported a collaborative working group requested by former Palauan President, Tommy Remengesau, Jr. to investigate major implications of the full implementation of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary and compile a report of the findings (see PICRC page or COS page). One key lesson from that experience was the importance of enhancing the capacity for managing and visualizing data driven messages to more effectively communicate significant management findings. Content: In this training package, you will learn about three core elements of data management and visualization. Chapter 2: Working with Data - including management of data resources, cleaning datasets, and normalizing &amp; standardizing data sets and databases. Chapter 3: Visualizing Data - including a focus on using Tableau software to build or enhance visualization skills and resources. Chapter 4: Communicating Data Stories - including core principles in overall data communication, lessons in building and telling stories using your data sets, and working with external partners on visuals (such as graphic designers). The concluding module (Chapter 5) includes a collection of final messages and resources to aid you in your path forward. Intended audience: In recognizing the wide range of roles and responsibilities individuals may have with respect to data use within an organization, this training is designed to be completed either in a sequence of all sessions from beginning to end or compartmentalized in modules and sessions to focus on specific skills. Whether you are a data novice interested in learning about all aspects of management and visualization, a data nerd who wants to learn more about visualization and communication, or a communications wizard who wants to be more familiar with data details or skills - this training package includes material to advance your understanding. This content is intended to equip you to better utilize and communicate data stories. In preparation for this course, it may help to briefly consider which data role(s) from the non-exhaustive list below best describes your interests and which lessons best suit your position and needs. Authors: This Data Management and Visualization Training package is a collaborative effort amongst researchers and staff from PICRC, NCEAS, and COS. The core contributors to the existing content are recognized below. 1.2 How to Use These Materials Overview: The content in the three core modules of this training package targets an audience of researchers or communicators seeking to build their skill set. Each chapter contains links to additional sessions or resources for those that are interested in deeper topical dives. Materials: Some sessions include distilled handouts or briefs as well as short exercises to help you practice the skills while you are developing them. Briefs: Documents that can be utilized as a standalone resource - compiling core messages from a session. Exercises: Self-guided practical work to facilitate learning and enable exploration from a more conceptual framework. Video Tutorials: Recorded lessons (primarily in Chapter 4: Tableau) providing stepwise guidance to the interface and content. Iteration: As previously mentioned, the content in this training package is intended to be revisited on an iterative basis as needed. You can proceed through the content in sequence or focus on the chapters or sessions of most interest to you. Regardless of your specific data-related role in an organization, there are opportunities to gain greater mastery through iterative practice and collaborative learning. Conclusion: The concluding chapter (Chapter 5) includes a compilation of resources for “at-a-glance” skill reminders and references for further investigation.

Rather, a successful communication approach will include learning what your audience desires and needs as well as building a relationship with the community you are trying to reach in order to anticipate future interests. In this module we present an engagement model of communication. In a deficit model of communication information flows one way. The scientist presents new information to an audience. On the other hand, an engagement model relies on including members of your audience as active collaborators in knowledge-building. Successful engagement means building trust and long-term relationships with the audience you hope to reach.

Messages are intended to lead your audience to action. Key term:Call to Action (CTA) What is the action you want to motivate people to? Write before you write. “Consider and articulate what your story is really about. Not the noun, the verb. It’s not enough to say your story is about, say, salmon. Is it a story about bears that eat salmon? Salmon that eat bears?” - Michelle Nijhuis in The Science Writers’ Handbook: Everything You Need to Know to Pitch, Publish, and Prosper in the Digital Age (2013) 2.4 The Message Box In preparing to communicate your scientific information, consider the use of targeted tools or practices to best focus your messages. One of the most popular tools in the science communication field is the Message Box - developed and shared by COMPASS. The Message Box is a tool that helps researchers take the information they hold about their research and communicate it in a way that resonates with the chosen audience. It can be used to help prepare for interviews with journalists or employers, plan for a presentation, outline a paper or lecture, prepare a grant proposal, or clearly, and with relevancy, communicate your work to others. While the message box can be used in all these ways, you must first identify the audience for your communication. The Message Box comprises five sections to help you sort and distill your knowledge in a way that will resonate with your (chosen) audience. How we communicate with other scientists (through scholarly publications) is not how the rest of the rest of the world typically communicates. In a scientific paper, we establish credibility in the introduction and methods, provide detailed data and results, and then share the significance of our work in the discussion and conclusions. But the rest of the world leads with the impact, the take home message. A quick glance of newspaper headlines demonstrates this. The five sections of the Message Box are provided below. For a detailed explanation of the sections and guidance on how to use the Message Box, work through the Message Box Workbook. Message Box Sections The Issue The “Issue” section in the center of the box identifies and describes the overarching issue or topic that you’re addressing in broad terms. It’s the big-picture context of your work. This should be very concise and clear; no more than a short phrase. You might find you revisit the Issue after you’ve filled out your Message Box, to see if your thinking on the overarching topic has changed since you started. The Problem The “Problem” is the chunk of the broader issue that you’re addressing in your area of expertise. It’s your piece of the pie, reflecting your work and expert knowledge. Think about your research questions and what aspect of the specific problem you’re addressing would matter to your audience. The Problem is also where you set up the “So What” and describe the situation you see and want to address. The So What The crux of the Message Box, and the critical question the COMPASS team seeks to help scientists answer, is “So what?” Why should your audience care? What about your research or work is important for them to know? Why are you talking to them about it? The answer to this question may change from audience to audience, and you’ll want to be able to adjust based on their interests and needs. We like to use the analogy of putting a message through a prism that clarifies the importance to different audiences. Each audience will be interested in different facets of your work, and you want your message to reflect their interests and accommodate their needs. The prism below includes a spectrum of audiences you might want to reach, and some of the questions they might have about your work. The Solution The Solution section outlines the options for solving the problem you identified. When presenting possible solutions, consider whether they are something your audience can influence or act upon. And remind yourself of your communication goals: Why are you communicating with this audience? What do you want to accomplish? The Benefit In the Benefit section, you list the benefits of addressing the Problem — all the good things that could happen if your Solution section is implemented. This ties into the So What of why your audience cares, but focuses on the positive results of taking action (the “So What?” may be a negative thing — for example, inaction could lead to consequences that your audience cares about). If possible, it can be helpful to be specific here — concrete examples are more compelling than abstract. Who is likely to benefit, and where, and when? In addition to the Message Box Workbook, COMPASS have resources on how to increase the impact of your message (include important statistics, draw comparisons, reduce jargon, use examples), exercises for practicing and refining your message and published examples. 2.5 Practice Exercise: Fill Out The Message Box For your own practice, fill out a sample Message Box with an example audience from your own work (e.g. a local school, government agency, or even internal leadership). You can download a blank message box or draft your own. Fill in your audience at the top of the Message Box. Fill out the Message Boxes 5 sections: “Issue”, “Problems”, “So What?”, “Solutions”, and “Benefits”.
