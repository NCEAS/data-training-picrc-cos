To address this need, data enthusiasts - such as you - have an opportunity to expand their knowledge base in working with complex data sets to creatively convey impactful, data-driven messages to a variety of audiences. This compilation of training materials is intended to provide an accessible, digestible resource for anyone interested in any aspect of data management or visualization. Background: This compilation of data management and visualization training materials stems from a multi-year engagement amongst the Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC), the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions (COS), and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) through financial support by Future Earth. The funding supported a collaborative working group requested by former Palauan President, Tommy Remengesau, Jr. to investigate major implications of the full implementation of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary and compile a report of the findings (see PICRC page or COS page). One key lesson from that experience was the importance of enhancing the capacity for managing and visualizing data driven messages to more effectively communicate significant management findings. Content: In this training package, you will learn about three core elements of data management and visualization. Module 2: Working with Data - including management of data resources, cleaning datasets, and normalizing &amp; standardizing data sets and databases. Module 3: Visualizing Data - including a focus on using Tableau software to build or enhance visualization skills and resources. Module 4: Communicating Data Stories - including core principles in overall data communication, lessons in building and telling stories using your data sets, and working with external partners on visuals (such as graphic designers). The concluding module (Module 5) includes a collection of final messages and resources to aid you in your path forward. Intended audience: In recognizing the wide range of roles and responsibilities individuals may have with respect to data use within an organization, this training is designed to be completed either in a sequence of all sessions from beginning to end or compartmentalized in modules and sessions to focus on specific skills. Whether you are a data novice interested in learning about all aspects of management and visualization, a data nerd who wants to learn more about visualization and communication, or a communications wizard who wants to be more familiar with data details or skills - this training package includes material to advance your understanding. This content is intended to equip you to better utilize and communicate data stories. In preparation for this course, it may help to briefly consider which data role(s) from the non-exhaustive list below best describes your interests and which lessons best suit your position and needs. Authors: This Data Management and Visualization Training package is a collaborative effort amongst researchers and staff from PICRC, NCEAS, and COS. The core contributors to the existing content are recognized below. 1.1.1 How to Use These Materials Overview: The content in the three core modules of this training package targets an audience of researchers or communicators seeking to build their skill set. Each module contains links to additional sessions or resources for those that are interested in deeper topical dives. Materials: Some sessions include distilled handouts or briefs as well as short exercises to help you practice the skills while you are developing them. Briefs: Documents that can be utilized as a standalone resource - compiling core messages from a session. Exercises: Self-guided practical work to facilitate learning and enable exploration from a more conceptual framework. Video Tutorials: Recorded lessons (primarily in Module 4: Tableau) providing stepwise guidance to the interface and content. Iteration: As previously mentioned, the content in this training package is intended to be revisited on an iterative basis as needed. You can proceed through the content in sequence or focus on the modules or sessions of most interest to you. Regardless of your specific data-related role in an organization, there are opportunities to gain greater mastery through iterative practice and collaborative learning. Conclusion: The concluding module (Module 5) includes a compilation of resources for “at-a-glance” skill reminders and references for further investigation. "],["working-with-data.html", "Module 2 Working with Data 2.1 Data Management 2.2 Data Cleaning 2.3 Normalization and Standardization 2.4 Terminology for Tableau", " Module 2 Working with Data 2.1 Data Management In this session File naming Storage Metadata Version control 2.1.1 Learning objectives Learn good practices to store, name and, keep track of different versions of your data files Understand the importance of metadata and use a template to create your own format 2.1.2 Value statement Learning how to properly store, name, and version control your files is the basis to developing systematic procedures to analyze and visualize data. Creating metadata files is essential to capturing key information about the context and content of a data file. Every data file should be accompanied by its metadata. By doing this, you can enable others to better understand your data and work more efficiently. 2.1.3 File naming While there is not a unique way to properly name your files, it is important to be consistent within your organization. Some of the best practices to do this include: 1 Use descriptive names that would make sense to any reader. For example, don’t use acronyms or abbreviations. Avoid the use of special characters, such as !@#$%^&amp;*() and others, these are sometimes not supported by some software. Make consistent use of capitalization. Are you going to use capital letters in every word? Maybe only at the beginning of the column name? For example: My_File1.xlsx vs. my_file1.xslx. While none of them is wrong, it is good to choose one format and stick to it Use underscores instead of blank spaces, just as in the example above. If you want to keep track of versions, don’t use endings such as “final”, “v5”, etc. Instead, we suggest that you either use the date in format YYYYMMDD, or use a version control system, as we will see in a later section. Don’t start a file name with a number, though it is fine to use numbers elsewhere in the name, as in the examples above. 2.1.4 Creating a working folder structure It is important to create a folder structure that will allow you and your colleagues to easily organize and retrieve any files that you are working with. There are some key principles to creating an efficient folder structure: Store your raw data in its own folder. Every time that you get new data, the first thing you should do is to create a backup by adding it to your raw data folder. This will allow you to always be able to come back to the original file and look for processing errors. Create a separate folder for “working” files. These are the files where you will change column names, clean data errors and merge multiple files when necessary. For example, if your team performs annual assessments of reef fish biomass, you may want to store separate files for each year, but combine them in a “master” file, which should be located in your “working” files folder. Having a consistent file structure across projects, such as folders for script outputs or figures, can make it easier for colleagues and collaborators to understand where to find the files they need. 2.1.5 Metadata Metadata are documentation describing the content, context, and structure of data to enable future interpretation and reuse of the data. Generally, metadata describe who collected the data, what data were collected, when and where it was collected, and why it was collected. Along with this class, we provided you with a metadata template. Please notice that this template can be adjusted to reflect your organization’s needs, therefore some of the requested information might change accordingly. Below, you will find an example of a filled out metadata template for the data that we will be using in Module 3. Make sure to always share the metadata along with your data files. Some recommendations to do this include: If working in Excel, create a new tab named “metadata” and put the information there If working in other data formats, create a new file with the metadata, store it in the same folder, and name it exactly the same as the data file, adding “_metadata” at the end. 2.1.6 Version control Version control is the process of tracking and organizing the changes you make to files over time. Throughout the lifetime of a project, using a system to keep track of different versions of your files and how and why you changed them can make it easier to revert to earlier versions of files or work collaboratively on the same files. Software like Git and the associated interface GitHub provide a version control framework, particularly useful for code scripts. If you are interested in learning more about Git and GitHub, this lesson and this portion of a course from NCEAS, focusing on using Git with R, are some starting points. For a broader overview of reproducible science, including the utility of version control, see this paper by Lowndes and colleagues. 2.1.7 Summary Well done, having a good folder structure, file naming practices, and version control capabilities are valuable tools to enable easy collaboration and to streamline workflows. Remember that using metadata is extremely important, this is the only way to make sure that you and your team know exactly what is included in a data file. Never share a database without its corresponding metadata. 2.2 Data Cleaning 2.3 Normalization and Standardization 2.4 Terminology for Tableau "],["visualizing-data.html", "Module 3 Visualizing Data 3.1 Tableau Basics 3.2 Tableau Skills Part 1: Basic plots with single variables 3.3 Tableau Skills Part 2: Multiple factors and dynamic tables 3.4 Tableau Skills Part 3: Operations and calculated fields 3.5 Tableau Dashboards Part 1: Basic dashboards 3.6 Tableau Dashboards Part 2: Graphic design elements 3.7 Publishing to the web from Tableau", " Module 3 Visualizing Data 3.1 Tableau Basics In this Session Learning Objectives Why Tableau? Installing Tableau User Interface Loading Data Opening a File Checking Data Types Sheets Summary 3.1.1 Tableau Basics: Learning Objectives Get familiar with the user interface of Tableau Learn how to connect data sets to Tableau interface 3.1.2 Why Tableau? We are focusing on Tableau for two primary reasons. First, Tableau can read a variety of data types, as you will learn in this session. This means that many different software applications and assets can be combined in a single visualization to present to your audience. Second, Tableau is extremely intuitive. Once you get a grasp of the basic skills, you can create compelling visualizations of data in half of the time it would take in other coding software applications. Note: For this training, all the exercises and examples were done with Tableau version 2021.1. 3.1.3 Installing Tableau Let’s get started with installing the software, to do so, go to https://www.tableau.com/ and select “Try Tableau for Free” Register your email address and username and download the software Once installed, input your key (you get one when you buy the software) and you are ready to go Important note: Tableau offers free 1-year licenses for educational purposes. If you belong to an academic institution, get a free license by going to https://www.tableau.com/community/academic. Once there, click on “Free student license”. You will need to provide information about your academic institution to validate your educational license. 3.1.4 User Interface Let’s open Tableau! The image below is what you will see the first time you open Tableau. Once you start to save workbooks, they will populate here under Open. The examples under Sample Workbooks are a great resource for inspiration to see the potential of Tableau. This column on the left is where you will load data. The Training and Resources tabs are very useful to help you keep learning new skills. If you are interested in investigating or expanding your skills, we recommend starting with the materials in these tabs, rather than searching for other sources on the internet. The materials in these two tabs are very well thought out and provide step-by-step instructions on how to learn new Tableau skills. 3.1.5 Loading Data The most important section of this interface is the Connect menu, where you will load data. There are three main categories of sources that you can load into Tableau. Tableau Server: Data you have saved through your Tableau account. We will not cover that process in this course because most of the users of this training will probably not have a server setup explicitly for Tableau. Connecting to a local file: Files from your computer can be Excel files, text files, statistical files, PDFs, and spatial files Text files include .csv .doc .log You are going to be using Text file frequently if you have .csv (comma separated value) files. Spatial files are commonly referred to as shape files or GIS files. If you have ever dealt with shape files, you might remember that shape files are composed of a few different files – some containing the coordinates, metadata, and a table. Tableau has made the adjustments necessary to load one shape file and all the associated files. As we will show this later in the course, you can load a shape file and Tableau will display it in a map with just a few clicks. Connecting to a server: You can connect to services that are online like Google Sheets, or Microsoft Office 365. One of the benefits of using this approach is that when you modify the original file, the modifications will be directly updated in Tableau. Let’s say you created a report with nice graphs in 2020 because that’s the data that you had when you created the report and then in 2021 you edited your Google sheet. The next time you open your Tableau workbook, all the data will be updated and contain the new data from 2021. It’s very important to make sure that you organize and manage your files such that you know exactly where your files are. Keep in mind that if you connect to a server, any changes that you make in the original file will have an impact on how your visualization looks in Tableau. 3.1.6 Opening a file Create a new folder on your desktop. Name the folder “Tableau Data Training” Download this file: CRM_Fish_edit and save it in the “Tableau Data Training” folder Follow along with this video to connect the new data file to Tableau Progress check-in. So far, you have: Downloaded an excel file and connected it to Tableau In Tableau, you learned about drag and drop. As Alfredo always says, “Tableau is all about drag and drop.” You connected the two tabs CRM_Fish and CMR_Site within the CRM_fish_edit Excel file—now in the Tableau interface. There is an orange line showing the connection. 3.1.7 Checking Data Types When you load a data file, you have to check that Tableau properly labels the data types. Here, we will discuss what those data types are and how they are assigned in Tableau. Dimensions and Measurements Dimension (also referred to as factor) is any information that is defined a priori of your actual sampling and helps to describe or categorize your results. Whenever you can call something a category it is a factor. Example: Site name, species, habitat, Measurements are the actual results of your sampling. They are usually numbers that you went into the field to measure. Example: Fish size, population count, temperature Tricky Case: Coordinates Coordinates are a factor when you already know the coordinates where you are going to take your sample. Example: You have ten sites that you visit each year to count the number of whales. The coordinates of each site are a factor because they are predetermined. You know where you are going to gather data each time. Coordinates are a measurement when it is part of the information that you are recording and it is not predefined. Example: you put a gps tracker on a whale and every time the whale surfaces, you record the coordinates. You did not know ahead of time where the whale would surface and the location is what the study is measuring. Tricky case: Is depth a factor or a measurement? Depth is a factor when indicating a transect location. Example: If you are always putting transects at either 3m or 30m you can categorize depth into shallow or deep. Depth is a measurement when it is recorded with every observation. Example: If you are swimming for 50 minutes to record visual observations of fish while also noting the depth at each observation, then depth is also a measurement. You measured and recorded your depth as you recorded the observation of the fish. Practice exercise: Time SCENARIO 1: Let’s say that you are birdwatching and you want to know what time of day birds are more active. You count the birds and you write down the time that you saw each bird. Is time a measurement or a factor? Answer: Measurement because you are registering the time every time you see a bird. SCENARIO 2: You want to know whether there are more birds in the morning, the afternoon, or in the evening. Answer: In this case, time is a factor because you go out three times a day, you count all the birds you see at that time and categorize by morning, afternoon, or evening. Types of Data Different ways computers classify data: Numeric - integers, decimals Any kind of numeric field, except Boolean (binary or true/false statements). Examples include integer, double, floating, etc. Text - strings, including special characters Yes/no, true/false - Also known as logical or boolean Spatial Location - Coordinates, Country Name, City Name, ZIP code Date and time. Tableau can recognize different date formats. One best practice is to separate fields for year, month, and day, which can be linked together directly in Tableau. Discrete and Continuous Data Discrete data refer to variables that can only be conceptualized in a unitary manner. It is quite similar to the difference between using many vs much. In this case, discrete data would be for things described as many. Example for text – color, name, city Example for numbers – number of transects conducted, position in a ranking Continuous data refer to variables that cannot be counted by units, but instead as continuous amounts. Following the example above, continuous data would be for things described as much. Example: number of fish recorded, total biomass, height, depth You should go through the preview of the data and ensure that each column is labeled correctly. Note: Never skip this step even if you have worked with the data set in Tableau before! The type of data is shown as symbols above the column title As you can see, the ID column is correctly labeled as a number; Data entry is a string (or text); and Date is a date (little calendar symbol). Note: Remember string is a synonym for text in Tableau. To change the label, click on the symbol and a drop-down menu will appear. The CRM_Fish table should look like this: The CMR_Site table should look like this: Notice that Latitude and Longitude are spatial data. If you open the drop-down, you will see that you can specify the type of spatial data provided under Geographic Role. 3.1.8 Sheets Sheets Cheat Sheet Discrete vs. Continuous DISCRETE is Blue CONTINUOUS is Green Factors vs. Measures Above the grey line is a FACTOR Below the grey line is a MEASURE 3.1.9 Tableau Basics Summary Great job! You have completed your first in depth Tableau session. Now, you know how to explore Tableau’s user interface, to connect a data file, check data types, and open sheets. 3.2 Tableau Skills Part 1: Basic plots with single variables In this Session Learning Objectives Value Statement Creating Your First Graph Basic Plots using the Marks Menu Line Plot Area Plot Map Bubble Plot Scatter Plot Editing and Formatting the Axes Saving my Files Homework Exercise Summary 3.2.1 Basic Plots: Learning Objectives Explore the user interface Learn how to make basic plots and customize them Learn how to save and share workbooks 3.2.2 Value statement Learning how to make basic plots in Tableau (e.g., bars, lines, pies, etc.) and how to take full control of the appearance will prepare you to take full advantage of Tableau’s more advanced skills. For this session we recommend that, if possible, have two screens open—one with Tableau and one with the course material—so you can follow along with the exercises. 3.2.3 Creating your first graph In the menu on the left, find Habitat under CRM_Fish Drag and drop Habitat into Columns - This will place Habitat in the x-axis of the graph Find Biomass under CRM_Fish Drag and drop Biomass into Rows - This will place Biomass in the y-axis. Congratulations! You just made your first bar plot in Tableau! 3.2.4 Entire View and Sorting 3.2.5 Show Me Menu The Show Me menu may pop up when you create a new graph. It looks like the image below. If the Show Me menu obscures your view, you can simply click on Show Me at the top and the menu will collapse. How to use the Show Me menu 3.2.6 Troubleshooting: Switching Rows and Columns Lilli has a question that came up when she was exploring the Show Me menu. When she tried to go back to a bar chart, the chart was flipped! Watch Alfredo’s answer: 3.2.7 Basic plots using the Marks menu The Show Me menu is a great tool where Tableau can suggest automated graphs, but we want to teach you how to take full control of Tableau. In order to do that, we will utilize the Marks menu. The Marks menu is located to the left of your bar graph: Color Here you can customize the color, opacity, and border of your graph. Click on More colors… and you will see even more options to customize your color palette. Practice: Insert a Hex Color Find the Hex Color field under More colors… For example, here is the “RGB Sliders” window on a Mac. Type or paste 4EC5B1 in the Hex Color # Now, your graph should be this color: Size If you click on Size, a slider will appear. In bar graphs, the slider changes the width of each bar. Let’s see how Size affects a pie chart. First, name this sheet “Bars.” REMEMBER TO ALWAYS NAME YOUR SHEETS To edit, double-click on the bottom where it says “Sheet 1” Create a new worksheet by clicking on the button directly to the right of “Bars”. Name this sheet “Pie”. In the new sheet, create exactly the same graph. Drag Habitat into Columns and Biomass into Rows. Go to Show Me and choose Pie Chart. The pie chart will look very small, so change the view to Entire View. Your current sheet should look like the image below: Try using the Size function in the Marks menu. Notice that when you change the size of this graph, you are changing the size of the whole pie chart. When you are changing something like the size, you have to experiment a bit to see what the software will do. Each graph type will respond differently to changing the size. Labels Details We will cover the Details marks in a later session. Tooltip Line Plot Practice Exercise: Create and modify a Line Plot Create a new sheet and name it “Line”. Drag Year into Columns and drag Biomass into Rows. For a line plot, summing the size of all the fish doesn’t make much sense. In this case, showing the average size of the fish per year makes more sense, so let’s do that. Right click on the field where it says SUM (Size cm) and a drop down menu will appear. Choose Measure, then click on Average. Does your plot now look like the image below? If so, you can move on to the next steps. Area plot Good job! From here, it is easy to change your Line plot to an Area plot. Under the Marks menu, open the dropdown menu where it says Automatic and click on Area. As you can see, there are many options in this dropdown menu. This is where you can manually change the type of plot displayed. Map There are two ways to create a map. First, on a new sheet you can drag and drop Longitude to Columns and Latitude to Rows. Remember that Columns are the x-axis and Rows are the y-axis. Your map should look like this: Next, clear the Columns and Rows fields. You can do this either by right-clicking and then choosing Remove or you can drag Longitude and Latitude back into the left column. Second, there is an even easier way to plug in geographic spatial data. Double-click Latitude and then double-click Longitude. If you assigned the data properly (i.e. Dimension, Geographic Role: Latitude), Tableau will know exactly how to create this map for you. Your map should look exactly the same as the previous visualization: Name this sheet “Map” Customizing the Map using the Marks menu Using the Color tool, change the color of the elements to a preferred color and add a black border. Using the Size tool, make the elements a bit larger so you can see them better. Remember that sliding to the right makes the elements larger and to the left makes them smaller. Do you notice anything missing? If we were to show this map to a collaborator, they would only see the Longitude and Latitude, but not the Site name. Let’s add the Site name to the Tooltip as dynamic text (or text that will be updated as the user interacts with the visualization). Find Site in the left column under CRM_Fish. Drag and drop Site into Tooltip in the Marks menu. Edit Tooltip to clarify the map for users. Click on Tooltip so we can edit the text. We want the name of the site to be at the top, so cut and paste “Site: &lt;ATTR(Site)&gt;” to move it above Latitude and Longitude. Delete the static text “Site:” leaving just “&lt;ATTR(Site)&gt;” at the top. Select all the text and change the alignment to center. Next, add “˚N” to the right of and “˚W” to the right of Mac shortcut: “Option + Shift + 8” Windows shortcut: “”Alt + 0176” (with Num Lock on) If you have trouble with the degree symbol, copy and paste from this text: ˚N ˚W Click OK to close the editing window and hover your cursor over your map to check that the tooltip is working. You have just created an interactive map showing the various sites around Palau where data was collected. Take a moment to explore the functionality of the map you created by moving your cursor around the map and clicking on a few of the data points. Bubble plot To create a Bubble plot, you always start with a Bar plot. In a new sheet, drag and drop Species into Columns and Biomass into Rows. Then, click on Show Me and choose Bubble E Voilá! A Bubble plot! Name this sheet “Bubble” Scatter plot Finally, let’s create a Scatter plot. Scatter plots are tricky; follow along with this video to learn about scatter plots in Tableau. Insert video Editing and Formatting the Axes “Biomass g” is not a very descriptive title for the x-axis. Let’s change it to give more information to a viewer. Double-click on the axis and an editing window will pop up. Under Title delete “Biomass g” and type “Total biomass (g)” Do the same for the y-axis. Replace the title with “Avg. Size (cm)” Now, we want to increase the font size to make the axes titles easier to read. Right-click on the y-axis and choose Format. Open the dropdown menu that says Font: and change the font size to 14 Do the same for the x-axis. When you are done, click on the X in the right corner of the Format window to exit. Saving my Files There are two primary ways to save your work in Tableau. The first is similar to saving any other type of file on your computer. Click on File &gt; Save As on the menu bar at the top of your screen. Name this file “Tableau_class_skills_1”. Save the file under your Tableau Data Training folder. Let’s take a look at the files. If you look at the Tableau Data Training folder, you’ll see that the Excel file CRM_Fish is 2.1 megabytes while the Tableau Workbook (.twb) that you just saved is 226 kilobytes. That’s significantly smaller than the original Excel file because your Tableau Workbook file doesn’t contain the data, it just has the instructions for what to do with the data. Therefore if you save .twb files (Tableau Workbook file) and you want to share them with a colleague, you also have to share the original data file. Packaged Workbooks The second way to save a file saves a compressed version of both the data file and the Tableau Workbook. This is called a Packaged Workbook. First, you have to create a data extract, which puts your data in Tableau format. On the menu bar at the top of your screen click on Data &gt; CRM_Fish &gt; Extract Data Click extract, name this file CRM_Fish_Extract, and save it in your Tableau Data Training folder. Now that you have created your extract, you will create a packaged file. In order to do that, go to File &gt; Export Packaged Workbook &gt; Save If you look at the folder in your finder, you will see that the new file type is .twbx which means it contains both the data and the instructions (Tableau Packaged Workbook file). If you want to share your work with colleagues who also have Tableau installed, you will share Packaged Workbooks (.twbx) with them. Homework Exercise Open data file Excel file CRM_Fish in Tableau, check field dimensions vs measure, data types, discrete vs. continuous. Create a bar plot, a pie chart, line, map, scatter plot Make presentable for an audience. Ensure that: Axes are legible size and descriptive titles Marks utilize nice and legible colors Tooltips provide useful information Name all worksheets Create a packaged workbook (.twbx) Check your work by comparing it with this file. Summary Congratulations! You are now equipped to create basic plots in Tableau and take full control of their design. You also know that when sharing your work with colleagues, you should always include the data, either as a separate file, or included in your workbook as a data extract. 3.3 Tableau Skills Part 2: Multiple factors and dynamic tables 3.4 Tableau Skills Part 3: Operations and calculated fields 3.5 Tableau Dashboards Part 1: Basic dashboards 3.6 Tableau Dashboards Part 2: Graphic design elements 3.7 Publishing to the web from Tableau "],["storytelling.html", "Module 4 Storytelling 4.1 Communication Principles 4.2 Data Storytelling 4.3 Working with Graphic Designers", " Module 4 Storytelling 4.1 Communication Principles In this Session Learning Objectives Prioritizing Engagement Salience, Credibility and Legitimacy Crafting your Message Practice Exercise: Fill Out The Message Box Resources 4.1.1 Communication Learning Objectives Approach science communication from an engagement framework Utilize tools like the “Message Box” for developing and crafting your message (Practice Exercise) 4.1.2 Prioritizing Engagement Science communication is more than dumping information on your audience. Rather, a successful communication approach will include learning what your audience desires and needs as well as building a relationship with the community you are trying to reach in order to anticipate future interests. In this module we present an engagement model of communication. In a deficit model of communication information flows one way. The scientist presents new information to an audience. On the other hand, an engagement model relies on including members of your audience as active collaborators in knowledge-building. Successful engagement means building trust and long-term relationships with the audience you hope to reach. Source: Twitter @TheComNetwork 4.1.3 Salience, Credibility and Legitimacy: Cornerstones of Effective Communication A focal point in effective communication to inform decision making is to consider the perceived salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the information from your audience’s perspective (Cash et. al. 2002). Another way to think of these terms could be the “when,” “who,” and “how” of the information provided. Salience: “… the relevance of information for an actor’s decision choices.” Ensure that the content you are providing is relevant to the decisions that your audience members encounter in a time frame that meets their needs. For example, there is limited value in informing a tourist that traveled to a beach that the water quality was unhealthy a week after they visited. Rather, aim to anticipate the needs of your audience members such that you can provide digestible information right when they need it. Credibility: “…whether an actor perceives information as meeting standards of scientific plausibility and technical adequacy.” The reputation of an organization or individual is of paramount importance when providing actionable information. Ensuring that “honest brokers of unbiased information” are the leading communicators enhances the perceived credibility of the information. This “credibility” consideration extends to every member of an organization or collaborative working group involved. Furthermore, after a period of time, audience members may desire to reflect on the accuracy of previous statements to gain an understanding of “how often have they been right?” Legitimacy: “…whether an actor perceives the process in a system as unbiased and meeting standards of political and procedural fairness.” In many cases, audience members strongly consider how the information was collected, analyzed and conveyed - as well as the process for engaging communities that are most closely tied to the content. This requires transparency in the process and ensuring that perspectives of impacted stakeholders are integrated into the overall message. 4.1.4 Crafting your message In order to create messages that stick, brainstorm your call to action and draft your core message. Messages are intended to lead your audience to action. Key term: Call to Action (CTA) What is the action you want to motivate people to? Write before you write. “Consider and articulate what your story is really about. Not the noun, the verb. It’s not enough to say your story is about, say, salmon. Is it a story about bears that eat salmon? Salmon that eat bears?” - Michelle Nijhuis in The Science Writers’ Handbook: Everything You Need to Know to Pitch, Publish, and Prosper in the Digital Age (2013) Good messages … Invite your audience into conversation Avoid jargon Instead, use descriptive language that your audience would be familiar with When you can’t find a perfect synonym for a jargon term, define the term or provide an analogy to something they are familiar with. Consider these examples of “jargony” terms and their “audience-friendly” counterparts: Anthropogenic → human-caused Ecosystem services → benefits from nature Harmful algal blooms → outbreak of toxic algae Submerged aquatic vegetation → underwater grasses We want to make our messages accessible by leveraging our audience’s existing knowledge and framing the language to be socially and culturally relevant. Note that this approach is distinct from simply “dumbing down” the content. Share about yourself to connect to their values, interests, and concerns. By sharing details about yourself and your background you can build trust with your audience and relate to them on a deeper level. Personal stories and connections can aid in establishing credibility and an attachment to the issue. Help people see themselves in your story. Find compelling hooks. A hook is the first part of a story that pulls people in. It conveys the significance and entices readers to keep reading. For example: Why is it important now? What makes this story timely? Can I tell this message through a story? People gravitate to stories and narrative structures. A good story captivates an audience’s attention and makes the message memorable. 4.1.5 The Message Box In preparing to communicate your scientific information, consider the use of targeted tools or practices to best focus your messages. One of the most popular tools in the science communication field is the Message Box - developed and shared by COMPASS. The Message Box is a tool that helps researchers take the information they hold about their research and communicate it in a way that resonates with the chosen audience. It can be used to help prepare for interviews with journalists or employers, plan for a presentation, outline a paper or lecture, prepare a grant proposal, or clearly, and with relevancy, communicate your work to others. While the message box can be used in all these ways, you must first identify the audience for your communication as that will drive your messaging. You would have a very different delivery for a group of scientists compared to a group of school children even with the same core message. The Message Box comprises five sections to help you sort and distill your knowledge in a way that will resonate with your (chosen) audience. How we communicate with other scientists (through scholarly publications) is not how the rest of the rest of the world typically communicates. In a scientific paper, we establish credibility in the introduction and methods, provide detailed data and results, and then share the significance of our work in the discussion and conclusions. But the rest of the world leads with the impact, the take home message. A quick glance of newspaper headlines demonstrates this. The five sections of the Message Box are provided below. For a detailed explanation of the sections and guidance on how to use the Message Box, work through the Message Box Workbook. Message Box Sections The Issue The “Issue” section in the center of the box identifies and describes the overarching issue or topic that you’re addressing in broad terms. It’s the big-picture context of your work. This should be very concise and clear; no more than a short phrase. You might find you revisit the Issue after you’ve filled out your Message Box, to see if your thinking on the overarching topic has changed since you started. The Problem The “Problem” is the chunk of the broader issue that you’re addressing in your area of expertise. It’s your piece of the pie, reflecting your work and expert knowledge. Think about your research questions and what aspect of the specific problem you’re addressing would matter to your audience. The Problem is also where you set up the “So What” and describe the situation you see and want to address. The So What The crux of the Message Box, and the critical question the COMPASS team seeks to help scientists answer, is “So what?” Why should your audience care? What about your research or work is important for them to know? Why are you talking to them about it? The answer to this question may change from audience to audience, and you’ll want to be able to adjust based on their interests and needs. We like to use the analogy of putting a message through a prism that clarifies the importance to different audiences. Each audience will be interested in different facets of your work, and you want your message to reflect their interests and accommodate their needs. The prism below includes a spectrum of audiences you might want to reach, and some of the questions they might have about your work. The Solution The Solution section outlines the options for solving the problem you identified. When presenting possible solutions, consider whether they are something your audience can influence or act upon. And remind yourself of your communication goals: Why are you communicating with this audience? What do you want to accomplish? The Benefit In the Benefit section, you list the benefits of addressing the Problem — all the good things that could happen if your Solution section is implemented. This ties into the So What of why your audience cares, but focuses on the positive results of taking action (the “So What?” may be a negative thing — for example, inaction could lead to consequences that your audience cares about). If possible, it can be helpful to be specific here — concrete examples are more compelling than abstract. Who is likely to benefit, and where, and when? In addition to the Message Box Workbook, COMPASS have resources on how to increase the impact of your message (include important statistics, draw comparisons, reduce jargon, use examples), exercises for practicing and refining your message and published examples. 4.1.6 Practice Exercise: Fill Out The Message Box For your own practice, fill out a sample Message Box with an example audience from your own work (e.g. a local school, government agency, or even internal leadership). You can download a blank message box or draft your own. Fill in your audience at the top of the Message Box. Fill out the Message Boxes 5 sections: “Issue”, “Problems”, “So What?”, “Solutions”, and “Benefits”.

Data storytelling: The process of translating data sets into stories, or messages that your target audience can understand. To learn a sample of approaches to data storytelling, including connecting stories and visuals to data for maximal effectiveness. 4.2.2 Value Statement Do not let your data go to waste! Learning how to effectively share engaging stories from data will allow your data, research, and synthesis to reach an increased range of audiences. Not everyone knows how to derive key insights and stories from your data, so increasing your data storytelling capacity will allow you to increase understanding and engagement from both internal and external organizational partners. 4.2.3 New Terms Data storytelling: The process of translating data sets into stories, or messages that your target audience can understand. 4.2.4 Receive Your Data The first step in effective data storytelling is to ensure you are working with clean, standardized data: This section assumes that the data you have to tell stories from is clean and standardized already. If your data is still raw and not cleaned, please refer to Module 2 in this training curriculum, titled “Data” to learn more about how to clean and standardize your data set. 4.2.5 Identify Your Audience Knowing your audience is one of the primary steps in effective communication. Crafting good messages is about building connections. The science you are representing will be more accessible to the communities who need it if messaging is customized for each audience. Take time to think about who your audience is for this project: Is this for local school kids, or for large international agencies? What are your audience’s needs or goals? How can members of your audience help co-create these materials? To help facilitate your thought process on who your audience is, we have included a handout and self-guided practice exercise below for you to use as a tool: “Identify Your Audience” Handout + Exercise What considerations are most relevant as we create these data stories? Drafting a short list of these considerations can be a helpful starting point when initiating a data visualization process. 4.2.6 Understand Key Insights After receiving your clean, standardized data, and identifying your audience, reserve time to review your data to discover key data insights that would be highly relevant to your audience: For example, if you are creating material for your internal conservation agency, look and see if there are any trends or relationships between your conservation practices and your measured conservation performance indicators. Determine insights that will draw the attention of your audience because these can amplify both the relevance and impact these insights will have. 4.2.7 Connect Stories To Key Insights Even if you have convincing graphs or numbers behind these key insights, it can still be hard for audience members to relate personally to these messages. Use relatable stories to bring key insights to life: For example, if you are sharing data insights on conservation efforts working with local fisheries, consider including a story of how local fishery members are reacting to recent conservation policy. Perhaps multiple stakeholders note the growing pains of the transition yet later begin to receive and recognize the value that results from the revised actions. The different perspectives noting the implications of the policy on their daily lives—in the short and long term—would make the material more approachable and engaging. Include these relatable, or personable, stories and anecdotes to more fully engage your audience in the story of your data. If you have difficulty selecting which stories to share, think about your target audience, and choose stories that they will likely relate to, or resonate with. Focus on what they need to hear; not just on what you want to say. 4.2.8 Utilize Engaging Visuals Furthermore, some audience members might only become more fully engaged with your data if you include engaging visuals—like graphs, maps, or other data visualizations—in your data storytelling. Data can be hard to visualize mentally, so having graphs or maps showcasing data for an audience can alleviate a lot of mental labor your audience will have to do: For example, audience members may not remember all the places a certain fish species lives, but having a map that shows the picture of the fish next to each of its local habitats can easily illustrate where this particular fish species is known to exist. Remember to focus on visuals or aesthetic details that will resonate with your audience. 4.2.9 Share Your Data Stories The last step is to share your data stories with your audience. In whatever way is most appropriate, share your data stories with your target audience. Whether you made a recorded Zoom presentation, or an Instagram post, share your data stories so that all this work does not go to waste: For example, imagine you recorded a short Instagram live video to share a data story on national conservation efforts for mangroves. If your goal is to increase general public awareness, then you could send that video along to local community organizations like schools, work places, or any other frequented community space. The main point in data storytelling is to encourage you to develop and share your data stories with the people who need them! Do not let the effort you and your colleagues have put into your research remain as untold stories. 4.2.10 Summary - Distilled details in this session brief Receive Your Data Identify Your Audience Understand Key Insights Connect Stories To Key Insights Utilize Engaging Visuals Share Your Data Stories 4.2.11 Learning Objectives 4.3 Working with Graphic Designers 4.3.1 Learning Objectives "],["conclusion.html", "Module 5 Conclusion 5.1 Content Review 5.2 Overview of Best Practices 5.3 Resource List", " Module 5 Conclusion In this Session XXX XXX 5.1 Content Review 5.2 Overview of Best Practices 5.3 Resource List "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
